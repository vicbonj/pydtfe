# density maps 2d

Author: Victor Bonjean

Mail: victor.bonjean40@gmail.com

- This is the seconde relase of pyDTFE, 100 times faster than the previous version -

A code to perform very easily and quickly density maps in 2d or in density cubes in 3d with a distribution of points in inputs, using the Delaunay Tesselation Field Estimator (PhD thesis: Schaap, W. E. (2007). DTFE: the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator s.n.), and scipy (http://www.scipy.org/).


- use "git clone https://github.com/vicbonj/pydtfe.git" in the folder you want
- cd pydtfe/
- run "python setup.py install" to install the code
- you can play with the notebook tutorial runnin the command "jupyter-notebook Density_map_2d.ipynb"
- test the examples and create your own maps or cubes with your own distributions of points !


--- In terms of compatibility, it's better to have the environment Anaconda (https://anaconda.org) installed on your computer, either 2.7 or 3.6. Otherwise, there is a requirements.txt ---
